# Hoodie Offline App

## About this app

I created this app for my "Building offline-first apps with Hoodie" talk at
[js.la](http://js.la/) in March 2017.

It’s is using [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) – The Offline First JavaScript backend.

But really it’s my attempt to put LA on the sweet.js map!

## Local Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/Ishtiaq11/hoodie-offline
cd hoodie-offline
docker-compose up -d
```
Check http://localhost:8080
